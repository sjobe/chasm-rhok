# to run this steering file in UNIX/LINUX edit the file paths and names
# to specify file path for each file relative to location of executable:

# at the prompt type: ./chasm_unix /<relative_path>/new_steeringfile.txt


geometry file:            <relative_path>/geometry.txt
soils database file:      <relative_path>/soils.txt
stability file:           <relative_path>/stability.txt
boundary conditions file: <relative_path>/boundary.txt

# the new 'output files:' keyword must now be specified with two variables which relate to whether different output files are required
# (0=no, 1=yes). The first output file records the hourly FOS; the second output file type includes two files recording: i) values of cell variables
# every hour (pore pressure and moisture content), and ii) minimum-FOS slip circle coordinates every hour.

output files: 1 1
output variables: 1 0 0 0 0
duration of the simulation (h): 360
time step (s):                  60
